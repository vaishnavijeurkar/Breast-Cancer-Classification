# Breast Cancer Classification Study

This repository contains the code and analysis for a study on classifying breast tissue samples as benign or malignant based on fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) data collected from 699 women in Wisconsin. The study aims to investigate the efficacy of nine characteristics, measured on a scale of one to ten, in accurately classifying tissue samples.

## Objective

The primary objective of this study is to determine if the characteristics obtained from FNAC alone can reliably classify breast tissue samples as benign or malignant. This research assumes that the dataset represents a random subset of women experiencing breast cancer symptoms.

## Methodology

The project will involve the following methodologies:

- **Logistic Regression Model with Best Subset Selection**: Utilizing logistic regression with best subset selection to identify the most relevant characteristics for classifying breast tissue samples.
- **Lasso Penalty Method**: Implementation of the Lasso penalty method to address potential issues of multicollinearity and overfitting in the logistic regression model.
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: Employing LDA to evaluate the discriminatory power of the characteristics in distinguishing between benign and malignant breast tissue.

## Potential Impact

A successful outcome of this study could significantly impact breast cancer diagnosis by providing a more informed basis for treatment decisions. Accurate classification of tissue samples based on FNAC characteristics could enhance the efficiency and accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.
